This was one of a series of 17 serial bomb blasts that took place within 70 minutes in various crowded places in Ahmedabad and killed a total of 56 civilians and injured 200 others. The bomb, which contained ammonium nitrate, ball bearings, a chemical powder, gelatin, plastic bags, cloth rags and a six volt Chinese-made battery attached to a timer device and stored inside a carton, was planted on an old bicycle.
